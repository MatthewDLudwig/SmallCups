# SmallCups
Small Cups of Java programs.  Each file can be run from the command line easily and has it's own main function.  Below you can find a quick description of each project.

## AutoLiker
One of the oldest Java projects I've still got laying around on my hard drive (too bad I lost all the others).  Was used to rapidly like a picture on facebook and then move on to the next one (using the up (like) and right (next) arrows).  Got blocked from liking photoes for a few days within a few minutes but managed to create 100+ notifications for the friend I was bothering so I count it as a win.

## Soundex
When I first found out about the Soundex algorithm I was interested in it and wanted to write my own.  It was to potentially be used to create a list of words similar to BIP2048 that could be used to represent a cryptocurrency address.  Needed to ensure that all words on the list sounded unique from each other.

## ImageCompiler
I've created a similar program to this one multiple times in the past but usually hard coded the file locations and was layering together 2-3 layers with 2-3 pictures possible for each layer.  Created this version to run from the command line and accept any number of bases, and layers.  All results end up in the "output" folder.
